# 📝 To-Do List Web App

A simple and responsive to-do list application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.  
It allows users to add, mark as complete, edit, and delete tasks with smooth interactions and a clean UI.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- DOM manipulation (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `replaceChild`)
- Event handling (`click`, `dblclick`, `keydown`)
- `classList.toggle`, `contains`, and CSS-driven UI behavior
- Styling with `position`, `flexbox`, and `absolute` elements
- Debugging layout issues and state handling manually
